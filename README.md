Front end for photography portfolio/store.

Built with React, deployed on Netlify. Payments handled by Stripe.

All photos / presets were taken / made by me.

The store was mainly for getting experience with payment processing and Stripe. 
It's currently in test mode, so you can try "purchasing" an Adobe Lightroom with [Stripe's test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).

The backend is decoupled in a [separate repo](https://github.com/xngln/photo-server). They communicate using GraphQL.
